h1. Google::Geo

A simple, elegant library for getting geocoding information from Google Maps. Very much inspired by the google-geocode gem, but completely dependency free!

h2. Examples
  
  geo = Google::Geo.new API_KEY
  
  addresses = geo.locate '1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA'
  addresses.size # 1, :locate always returns an Array
  
  address = addresses.first
  address.country      # 'US'
  address.city         # 'Mountain View'
  address.full_address # '1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA'  
  address.query        # '1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA'
  address.accuracy     # 8
  address.coordinates  # [-122.084143, 37.421972, 0.0]
  
In the case of sufficiently vague queries, Google::Geo will return more than one:
  
  addresses = geo.locate 'hell'
  addresses.size                # 2
  addresses.map { |a| a.state } # ['PA', 'NC']
